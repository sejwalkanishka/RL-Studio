# 🧠 RLStudio: Learning by Doing, Optimizing by Experience

**A creative playground for Reinforcement Learning—where agents evolve, environments challenge, and decisions get smarter.**

Welcome to **RLStudio**, a curated collection of experiments, simulations, and visualizations in Reinforcement Learning (RL). This repository explores how intelligent agents learn to navigate complex environments through trial, error, and reward—bridging the gap between theory and intuition.

## 🎯 Why RLStudio?

Because intelligence isn’t just coded—it’s earned.  
Because learning from experience is the most human thing a machine can do.  
Because every reward tells a story.
